# Gem Drop
HTML5 Puzzle Game, inspired by 'Dr. Mario' built as a part of a final-year project, utilising Phaser.js and PHP for online highscores. Included in the repository is the full source-code and all accompanying assets. Hopefully someone finds it useful for building their own game - or just for learning.
