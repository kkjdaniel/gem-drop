Gem Drop is a HTML5 Puzzle Game, inspired by classic arcade titles such as Dr. Mario and Tetris. The project was built as part of a final-year project for my degree at the University of Leicester. It utilises Javascript with Phaser.js - and PHP for the online highscores. Included in the repository is the full source-code and all accompanying assets.
